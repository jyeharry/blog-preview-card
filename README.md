## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to declare variable fonts in CSS:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('../assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

I also took accessibility into consideration by using more semantic html tags and attributes such as the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the surrounding `<a>` around the card.

### Useful resources

- [developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - I mainly just used various pages on MDN.
